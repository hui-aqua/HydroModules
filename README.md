# HydroModules
--- A hydrodynamic module for aquaculture structures.

**The main aim for the development of this module is to provide a controllable and repeatable numerical solution for reliable analyses of aquaculture structures.** 


> Although considerable numerical programs have been proposed with a large number of publications, most of the proposed numerical program are either  commercial or in-house. In order to promote the availability  and accessibility of numerical simulations for aquaculture structures, a hydrodynamic modules is developed here for conducting time-domain structural analysis of aquaculture structures with [code aster](https://www.code-aster.org/V2/spip.php?rubrique2). 



### Work environments

In order to use this module, you need to install the following packages or programs first:

* [python 3.6 (or higher)](https://www.python.org/)

* [Numpy 1.21 (or higher)](https://numpy.org/)

* [Code_aster 14.6 (or higher stable version)](https://www.code-aster.org/spip.php?article272)

  Please check if `as_run` located at the following default installation path:

  > /opt/aster146/bin/as_run

  If not, you need to change Line 21 in [`run.sh`](./Example/run.sh) and Line 2 in [`ASTERRUN.export`](./Example/asterinput/ASTERRUN.export) according to your environments.

* [salome_meca 2019.0.3 (or higher)](https://www.code-aster.org/spip.php?article303)

  Please check if `salome` located at the following default installation path:

  Default installation path:

  > /opt/salome_meca/appli_V2019.0.3_universal/salome

  If not, you need to change Line 7 in [`run.sh`](./Example/run.sh) according to your environments.



### Run your first case

The [Example](./Example/README.MD) folder provide a simple setup for a squared fish cage under pure current conditions. 

1. Open a terminal and change the directory to the `Example`

2. Type the command:

   ``` shell
   sh run.sh
   ```

3. Wait until the job finish. If it shows `exit_code=0` at the end, it means the simulation finish without any error.

4. Want to clean the generated file and run a different cases? use `sh clean.sh ` to clean these files and run again.
